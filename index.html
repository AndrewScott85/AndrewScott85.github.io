    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a friendly and enthusiastic full-stack software developer, due to graduate at the end of June from the
        award-winning <a href="https://io-academy.uk">iO Academy</a> 16 week coding bootcamp in Bath. In my spare time,
        I like reading, travel, cooking,
        swimming, any and all watersports, going to the gym, and learning languages.
    </p>
    <p>After taking a career break for a couple of years to travel and work as a
        scuba diving instructor, I spent last year investigating various careers to figure out what I really want to do
        with my life, and was naturally drawn to online coding courses. This led to signing up for the iO Academy course
        which has only increased my enthusiasm to make a career in software development.

            <p> An OOP application in PHP, styled using SASS, which takes data on a collection of cars from an
                API in JSON format, uses it to build a database in MySQL, then fetches that data to display a
                searchable, filterable collection of cars - clicking on any of the cars opens a new page showing car
                information in more detail. This was a great project for getting into working in an OOP manner, as well
                as good practice in SQL.
            </p>

            <p>The front end of a food delivery app, built in React and styled using Bootstrap, to a specification laid
                out in high fidelity wireframes. Fetching from an API to
                display a list of available restaurants and a filterable menu for each restaurant. Items can be added
                an order basket, which calculates the total cost. Submitting an order opens a modal window displaying
                the
                ETA and a progress bar. This app provided a good chance to get familiar with working in React and
                Bootstrap to produce an App to match a given visual design.</p>

            <p> A word guessing game built using javascript. Target words and synonyms are fetched from an api, and on
                starting a new game, a random target word is selected, and its synonyms are displayed to the player,
                who is given 5 attempts, or a maximum of 30 seconds to guess the target word. This app was really fun to
                make, and good practice in javascript and css.
