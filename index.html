    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm currently studying full-stack web development at iO-Academy in Bath. Prior to joining this course, I'd worked in several industries, most recently working as a scuba diving instructor.</p>
      
      <p>After deciding it was time for a career change, I remembered how much I'd enjoyed the introductory coding courses completed at university and decided now is the time to follow this up.</p>
